# NFT-Based Loyalty Program

## Project Description

The NFT-Based Loyalty Program is a blockchain-based customer loyalty system that rewards customers with unique NFTs based on their purchase history. Unlike traditional point-based systems, this program leverages the power of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to create unique, tradeable, and verifiable loyalty rewards that customers truly own.

## Project Vision

To revolutionize customer loyalty programs by creating a transparent, secure, and customer-owned reward system using blockchain technology. Our vision is to empower customers with digital assets that have real value and can be traded, collected, or used across multiple platforms while providing businesses with an innovative way to build customer engagement and retention.
